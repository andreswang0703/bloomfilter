This is an implementation of [Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter).

It acts similar to a HashSet, but elements can't be deleted. False positive is possible but false negative is not possible. 
It's extremely space efficient compared to HashSet since it doesn't store all the elements.
